	<h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>We present a design prototype that demonstrates new locomotion techniques for social virtual reality experiences. Specifically, we
		showcase three teleportation-based techniques which, together, support
		users as they join other groups of people, and help them move together
		in virtual environments. The new interactions include a technique to
		join a group with option for adjacency, the ability to “reverse teleport”
		a user to your own group, and finding a consensus on where to teleport together. We argue that our new locomotion techniques maintain
		the simplicity of current teleportation-based techniques while supporting
		new interactions with people. We present our design prototype so that
		we can explore how new teleportation-based techniques can be designed
		to better support prosocial behaviour, but also highlight their potential
		to disrupt social experiences in social VR.
